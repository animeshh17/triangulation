# MESH-CREATOR
A Simple Web Applet that creates a real-time mesh using delaunay triangulation
based on the given points as the input

To see the algorithm working in all its glory, just click/tap anywhere
and keep adding more and more points to see how this program coverts
the points into a triangulated map/mesh using incremental flip algorithm.
